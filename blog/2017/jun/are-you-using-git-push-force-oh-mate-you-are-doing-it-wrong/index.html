So, surprise surprise, you got a merge conflict to resolve!</p><p>This usually means you will need to do a <em>git rebase</em> before merging. After doing it, this new rebased branch need to be pushed back to the remote. And here is one of the steps that people usually do wrong:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>git push —-force
</code></pre></div><p>You might be thinking: what is the problem with this?</p><p>Well, <strong>push force</strong> ignore everything on the remote and override it with local changes. This is &ldquo;kinda&rdquo; what you want, but what if you did some mistake in the rebase but didn&rsquo;t notice? Or someone pushed more modifications while you were rebasing? Yes, you thought right: kaputt, gone. One safer way to do this is using:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>git push --force-with-lease
</code></pre></div><p>This simple command will not push force your modifications until it checked if everything that is in the remote is also in your rebased version. It is the same as a <em>push force</em>, but safer.</p><p>If you want to know more about it, checkout <a href=https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/>this article</a>. But the basic idea is: <strong>start to use <em>force-with-lease</em> instead of <em>force</em></strong>.</p></div><footer class=post-footer></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2022 <a href=https://brunoluiz.net>Bruno Luiz Silva</a></span>
